## Last Week's Accomplishments

> Got familiar of the crawler and its theory... although it seems useless to our APP.\

> Getting started with Python Kivy to design possible UI.\

## This Week's Plan

> Study the Kivy programs and demos from the internet.\

> Keep learning the course in Udemy to keep track.\

> Start building our database.\

## Anything Blocking?

> We were able to use the crawler to crawl some of the pictures in a website, but we had difficulty crawling down the\
> courses with maybe keywords. We were thinking about hardcoding in the database, but that would be so time-\
> consuming.

> A back-up plan was getting input from user. But whichever way, we decide to switch our focus to the APP itself first\
> , and maybe later we could consider adding different kinds of data.

## Notes

> Change in our general plan: focusing on APP itself first.
