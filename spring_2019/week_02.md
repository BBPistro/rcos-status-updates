## Last Week's Accomplishments

> In the past week I built the basic data structures of the scheduler and made the basic functions that could \
> help the students adding courses, comments, changing "virtural currency", etc.\

## This Week's Plan

> We will be researching the Python crawler and find a way to read courses in the public course catalog in \
> universities and try to think of a way to store them in our database. Our database is written in SQL.

## Anything Blocking?

> Nothing blocked me last week since I was just implementing the C++ data structures.\

## Notes

> Registered in a Udemy course that teaches how to build an IOS app. Hopefully this would help us for the project.\
