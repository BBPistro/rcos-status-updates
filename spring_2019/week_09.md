## Last Week's Accomplishments

> Data addition works fine on Firebase, and the APP is beginning to run their basic funtions. Some modules cannot be done by normal methods. Probably need to use Cocoapods.

## This Week's Plan

> Explore Cocoapods to add more modules in my APP

> Explore Completion Handler in XCode

## Anything Blocking?

> Having trouble building Swift Classes and pass data between different View Controller.
